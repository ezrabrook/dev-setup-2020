Development Setup for OSX 
===============================

Started with Assistance from the Repo by [striveforbest](https://github.com/StriveForBest/osx-dev-environment-setup) updated for July of 2020
Also, adding more information with medium article from Vinicius De Antoni [How to Set Up Your Macbook for Web Development in 2020](https://medium.com/better-programming/setting-up-your-mac-for-web-development-in-2020-659f5588b883)


Assumptions: 
//TODO
Your Mac
Your Homebrew
Your Xcode V

Instructions: 
After Xcode, Homebrew and the Shells, install as needed.

Xcode
-----

Install Xcode from the App Store.
Install Command Line Tools::

    xcode-select --install

Homebrew
--------

Install::

    /bin/bash -c â€œ$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
    brew doctor

You can use either `bash` or `zshell`, your choice.

Bash
----

Install::

    brew install bash

Update the default shell::

    sudo vim /etc/shells

Paste in above all other entires::

    /usr/local/bin/bash


Add the path to the shell you want to use if not already present, then set it::

    chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

wget
----

Install::

    brew install wget

Z shell
-------

Install::

    brew install zsh zsh-completions zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:

      fpath=(/usr/local/share/zsh-completions $fpath)

    You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

      rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit

    Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting
    to load these completions, you may need to run this:

      chmod go-w '/usr/local/share'

Oh My Zsh
---------

Oh My Zsh is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration. `Instructions <https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh>`_

Install::

    sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"

powerlevel9k
------------

Oh My Zsh theme. `Instructions <https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Install-Instructions#option-2-install-for-oh-my-zsh>`_

Install::

    git clone git@github.com:bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k

Install powerline `fonts <https://github.com/powerline/fonts>`_::

    git clone git@github.com:powerline/fonts.git  ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/fonts
    cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/fonts
    ./install.sh

Keep in mind, you'll need to set the fonts in your `iTerm` Settings -> Profiles -> Text -> Change Font -> Meslo LG S DZ Regular for Powerline.

.zshrc
------

``~/.zshrc`` is available on `Dotfiles repository <https://github.com/StriveForBest/dotfiles>`_

Now link ``.zshrc`` and ``bin``::

    cd
    ln -s /path/to/dotfiles_repo/.zshrc
    ln -s /path/to/dotfiles_repo/bin
    source ~/.zshrc

rsync
-----

Replace OSX's default ``rsync``::

    brew install rsync

s3cmd
-----

    brew install s3cmd

Programming Languages & Web Frameworks
======================================

Python
------

Homebrew installs pip and distribute by default when installing Python::

    brew install python

pyenv (optional)::

    brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv pyenv-virtualenvwrapper

pip3::

    pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
    pip3 install --upgrade pip

virtualenvwrapper::

    pip3 install virtualenvwrapper

Frontend Tools
--------------

Node::

    brew install node

Npm::

    npm install npm -g

Npm-X (makes commands from local environment available)::

    npm install npx -g

Version Control
===============

Git::

    brew install git

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    The OS X keychain credential helper has been installed to:
      /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain

    The 'contrib' directory has been installed to:
      /usr/local/share/git-core/contrib

    Bash completion has been installed to:
      /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d

    zsh completion has been installed to:
      /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions

    cd ~/.ssh
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "alex.zagoro@eagerminds.nyc"
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Set global git settings::

    git config --global user.name "Alex Zagoro"
    git config --global user.email "alex.zagoro@eagerminds.nyc"
    git config --global color.ui true

//todo: 
GPG Signing::

    There are many ways of installing GPG client, the easiest one is via Homebrew or `GPG Suite <https://gpgtools.org/>`_.
    After generating the key, add it in `Github settings <https://github.com/settings/keys>`_ and then follow this `article <https://help.github.com/articles/telling-git-about-your-gpg-key/`_ to tell GPG about your key.

Data Stores
===========

PostgreSQL
----------

Just download and install Postgres.app from https://postgresapp.com/ (which comes with Postgis)

Enable CLI::

	sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d && echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp


MySQL
-----

PostgreSQL is always preferred but sometimes you don't have a choice::

    brew install mysql

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
    server starting up correctly.

    To connect:
      mysql -uroot

    To have launchd start mysql at login:
      ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load mysql now:
      launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
      mysql.server start

Create a database and set permissions for development::

    mysql -uroot

    CREATE DATABASE project CHARACTER SET UTF8;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON project.* TO 'web'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

MongoDB
-------

Install::

    brew install mongodb

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To have launchd start mongodb at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load mongodb now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        mongod


You have to create a data directory. By default it expects the data to be stored in ``/data/db``
Otherwise, create a directory and pass the path when running the server::

    mongod --dbpath=/Users/sallysue/Projects/data/mongodb

Redis
-----

Install::

    brew install redis

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To have launchd start redis at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load redis now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

Memcached
---------

Install::

    brew install memcached

Output::

    To have launchd start memcached at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/memcached/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load memcached now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.memcached.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        /usr/local/opt/memcached/bin/memcached


Search Engine Backends
======================

ElasticSearch
-------------

Install::

    brew install elasticsearch

Run in on system start::

    brew services start elasticsearch


Web Servers
===========

Nginx
-----

Install::

    gem install passenger
    brew install nginx //--with-passenger --with-debug --with-spdy --with-gunzip

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

    The default port has been set to 8080 so that nginx can run without sudo.

    If you want to host pages on your local machine to the wider network you
    can change the port to 80 in: /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    You will then need to run nginx as root: `sudo nginx`.

    To have launchd start nginx at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load nginx now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist
